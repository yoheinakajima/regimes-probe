# QUERY_POLICY.md

## Purpose (Level 2: query formulation)

Once Level 1 routing (`docs/ROUTING_POLICY.md`) selects a tool, the query policy decides
**how to query** it. A `query_plan` selects a **query policy arm** (a transformation from
question to query string), scored by the contextual bandit
(`docs/CONTEXTUAL_BANDIT.md`) using trace-derived `query_template_rewards`
(`docs/POLICY_MEMORY.md`).

There are **no hard-coded topical categories**. Arms are generic epistemic
transformations; their priors are conditioned on latent regimes and generic query
signatures.

## Query policy arms

| Arm | Definition |
|---|---|
| `direct_question` | Pass the (normalized) natural-language question through unchanged. |
| `keyword_compressed` | Strip stopwords/function words; keep salient content tokens and entities. Improves recall for `query-fragile` signatures. |
| `quoted_entities` | Wrap detected named entities / exact phrases in quotes to force exact-match retrieval. |
| `source_constrained` | Append source-quality constraints (e.g., authoritative-source operators) for `source-authority-sensitive` signatures. |
| `freshness_terms` | Inject recency tokens / date hints for `freshness-sensitive` / `staleness-prone` signatures. |
| `exact_answer_shape` | Add tokens cueing the required answer shape (date, number, name, enum) for `answer-shape-constrained` signatures. |
| `site_or_domain_constrained` | When a domain is known, constrain to that site/domain (e.g., `site:` operator). Only valid when a domain is available. |

Arms are not mutually exclusive in principle, but v0 selects **one arm per `query_plan`**
(composition is left to learned, tool-specific templates).

---

## Arm examples

Example question: **"Who won the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest?"**
(detected entities: `Eurovision Song Contest`; signature includes `freshness-sensitive`,
`answer-shape-constrained`; domain `eurovision.tv` known.)

| Arm | Resulting query string |
|---|---|
| `direct_question` | `Who won the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest?` |
| `keyword_compressed` | `2026 Eurovision Song Contest winner` |
| `quoted_entities` | `"Eurovision Song Contest" 2026 winner` |
| `source_constrained` | `2026 Eurovision Song Contest winner official results` |
| `freshness_terms` | `2026 Eurovision Song Contest winner latest results` |
| `exact_answer_shape` | `2026 Eurovision Song Contest winner name` |
| `site_or_domain_constrained` | `Eurovision Song Contest 2026 winner site:eurovision.tv` |

The exact transformation logic per arm is deterministic and **template-driven** so runs
are replayable.

---

## Learned and tool-specific templates

- **Query templates can be learned and scored.** Each arm maps to one or more parametric
  templates; their `query_template_rewards` are tracked per `(regime_label, signature)`
  and per tool, so the bandit learns which arm/template wins where.
- **Tool-specific templates are allowed.** The same arm may render differently for
  different tools (e.g., a web search engine vs. a news API vs. a fetch tool), because
  operator syntax differs. Templates are keyed by `(arm, tool)`.

---

## LLM use in query generation (v0 only, gated)

An LLM may generate a query string in v0 **only if** all of the following hold:

1. **Logged** — the prompt, model, and output are recorded in the raw trace archive.
2. **Cached** — identical inputs return the cached output.
3. **Deterministic enough for replay** — fixed model + decoding params + cache, so a
   replay reproduces the same query string.
4. **Replaceable by templates later** — the generated query must be expressible as, and
   later swapped for, a learned template, so the LLM is not a permanent dependency.

The default and target system uses learned template selection, not an LLM.

---

## Benchmark must distinguish three query modes

The benchmark explicitly separates and labels these conditions so results are comparable:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **generic LLM query** | An LLM formulates the query (gated as above). Upper-bound / reference condition. |
| **learned template selection** | The contextual bandit selects among the query policy arms / learned templates. This is the system under test. |
| **fixed query baseline** | Always use a single fixed arm (e.g., `direct_question`) with no learning. Lower-bound baseline. |

Each `query_plan` records which mode produced it, so `correct_per_tool_call` can be
attributed and compared across modes.

---

## Selection (reuses the contextual bandit)

```
function choose_query_plan(ctx, tool, snapshot, mode, now_tick, domain_known):
    arms = [direct_question, keyword_compressed, quoted_entities,
            source_constrained, freshness_terms, exact_answer_shape]
    if domain_known:
        arms.append(site_or_domain_constrained)     # only valid when a domain exists

    # score_tool / choose_tool_plan operate over the query_template arm family
    plan = choose_tool_plan(ctx, snapshot, mode, now_tick, available_arms = arms)

    query_string = render_template(plan.chosen_arm, tool, ctx)   # deterministic
    return QueryPlan(
        arm = plan.chosen_arm,
        tool = tool,
        query_string = query_string,
        ranked = plan.ranked,
        query_mode = "learned_template_selection",   # or generic_llm_query / fixed_query_baseline
        explanation = plan.explanation
    )
```

## Failure regime addressed

| Regime | How query policy relates |
|---|---|
| `query_miss` | Poorly-formed query returns no usable evidence; corrected by learning `query_template_rewards` per signature (`query-fragile`, `evidence-sparse`). |
